# unicorn-companies
> **NOTE:** *This project is an EDA for a dataset provided by Maven Analytics using BASE SAS.*

## What is the purpose of this project? 
This project is to show my beginner knowledge of coding in base SAS, which is written in the C language, and a very minimalistic visualization in Excel.

## Where did the dataset come from?
Maven Analytics provides small simple datasets for analyst to practice their skills with. The dataset that I have chosen to analyze is the Unicorn Companies dataset. The Unicorn Comapnies in this dataset are private companies with a valuation over $1 billion as of March 2022. There is a total of 10 variables in this dataset including each company's current valuation, funding, country of origin, industry, select investors, and the years they were founded and became unicorns. The data structure is a single table iwth 1,074 records (very very small).

### Recommended Analysis from Maven Analytics:
1. Which unicorn companies have had the biggest return on investment?

2. How long does it usually take for a company to become a unicorn? Has it always been this way?

3. Which countries have the most unicorns? Are there any cities that appear to be industry hubs?

4. Which investors have funded the most unicorns?



## What is included in this project?
In this repo I provide my code written in SAS, and my visualization from Excel.
